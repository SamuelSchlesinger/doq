# Name

What is your character known by? If there are multiple names, that's okay,
describe why in the backstory.

# Backstory

What is the story of your character? Can leave out parts if you want, but give
us some flavor to work with. If you leave stuff out, maybe give some hints in
the other sections so I can include it in the story.

# Appearance

This is a description of your character's appearance.

# Reputation

You should describe your character's public reputation. You don't need to
include details which you want to retain for yourself.

# Goals

What are your character's goals? This can be as open-ended or specific as you
want, and making it related to the world description is ideal. Your character's
goals can be open ended or general, but the moderator should still be
influenced in their story generation by them.

# Competencies

What are your character's skills and competencies? For each one, the origin of
the skill needs to be given, and prodigal characters will probably be asked to
reduce their skills in some ways. Other than that, these should be creative and
flavorful, so that the moderator can use them to create a creative and
flavorful story.

# Problems

A description of your character's problems. They might have a bad back, become
anxious in crowds, or have a bad credit reputation in local municipalities,
get creative.
