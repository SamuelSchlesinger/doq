# Name

Georgis Halfhand

# Appearance

Georgis is old looking, conveying nightmarish experiences with his scars and
eyes. He has rough-hewn grey hair with a receeding hairline. He tends to wear a
bearskin overcoat typical of off-duty Duq soldiers, but totes a Mednem
harvester bag around his waist in order to carry his wares. He wears cotton
pants, a staple of coastal Mednem life.

# Backstory

Georgis has spent his years fighting the Heuzha on behalf of the receeding
Mednem.  When he was a boy, the Mednem were a healthy, peaceful people, and he
hates the Heuzha, as his favorite town to visit for tasty snacks was raided by
them and turned into pasture. His only goal for a long time was to stop the
Heuzha from pushing Mednem from their homes, and he fought as a mercenary
alongside the bravest of the Mednem for a while. After a long career of
fighting, his energy faded, and he began to travel between settlements and sell
the wares he used to love receiving from the Mednem settlements. He carries
food products and clothing to and from various Mednem, Duq, and occasionally
Heuzha settlements.

# Reputation

Georgis is known among some as a soldier, and others as a trader. For those who
knew him during his soldier days, mostly Mednem warriors he fought alongside
and Heuzha he fought against, he's an idealistic fighter who led many men and
slayed many mounts, even at times helping to recapture settlements. To those
who know him as a trader, they see him as a means to an end for the most part,
one of the only people left who are tough enough to traverse the wild and often
overgrown pasturelands where the Mednem used to farm.

# Goals

Though his new trading life has the benefit of not putting himself in harms way
willingly, and he can spread the joys of the old Mednem cuisine, he yearns for
the day he can roam a rich Mednem interior as an old soldier, drinking their
cider and dipping their bread in their wonderful vinegars. He also wouldn't mind
finding some really good recipes and learning how to cook, so he can experience
some of that without the help of a resurgent civilization.

# Competencies

Georgis is a skilled swordsman and archer, and is skilled at traversing the land
efficiently and quickly, foraging along his way. His more violent skills are rusty,
but might come back quick if put in a bad situation.

# Problems

Georgis is a war veteran, and as such can have fits of remembrance which lead
him to have serious issues. These can impact him in social situations as well
as combat, and will lead to a loss of control with potentially horrific
consequences. His age can hurt him in certain actions, and his lack of cultural
awareness or appreciation for the new Heuzha inland can lead him to have
serious problems interacting with it.
