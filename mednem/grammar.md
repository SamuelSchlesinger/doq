# Grammar of Mednem

The primary structure of Mednem is the constraint. Instead of having words like
"this" or "that", one can introduce an arbitrary variable by naming it with an
introductory particle. The variables work the same way names do in English,
where they can be introduced and discussed for any period of time. A helpful
translation of the introductory particle in English might be "there exists X",
but don't take this too literally. There are two introductory particles, nyuh /ɲɜ/
and nya /ɲɐ/.

When one says nyuh Deeg /dig/, it introduces a new entity to our discussion
called Deeg. Deeg can now be used as an identifier. An identifier serves to
point to a specific person, concept, action, object, or really anything one can
think to identify with a name. One can use identifiers with constraining phrases
which can allow a listener or reader to identify what this name is referring to.
Identifiers can be combined via the phrase ha /hɐ/ to create a composite identifier
which refers to all of those things. The nya particle introduces a permanent identifier
specific to the social context in which it was said. This might be a good way of
telling someone your name, like "nya Sham shi nyo", where nyo /ɲʌ/ means something
like "me".

A constraining phrase consists of an identifier, potentially being introduced
by an introductory particle, and the constraining particle shi /ʃi/. After the
shi, there is a class which the identifier is a part of. There is the empty
class, dod /dʌd/, the class of every possible thing, nam /nɐm/, and a class
corresponding to every identifier, ni /ni/ [identifier], indicating all of the
possible things that identifier could refer to. Classes are similar to
adjectives and nouns in English in some ways. Essentially, they are ways to
group entities which serve both purposes. Classes can be unioned
with dosh /dɐʃ/, intersected with nosh /nɐʃ/, and negated with unye /ɜɲe/.

Going backwards, one can turn a class into an identifier with the combinator
muh /mɜ/. The idea here is that because we've allowed identifiers to be
turned into classes, classes fundamentally can be as ill specified as identifiers.
Thus, a very common pattern might be to say: "nyuh Deq shi X. Deq shi Y". This
construction allows one to shorten this into "muh X shi Y".

Within a constraint, one can use the term guh /gɛ/ to refer to the identifier
to the left side of the corresponding shi. This allows you to refer to it in
one syllable rather than repeating it.

Other than these aspects and a shared core of vocabulary, pronunciation, and
phonetics, the Mednem language has many varied dialects. There remains only one
more consistent aspect to the language which is flavored by regional
differences: the concept of a relation between classes. A relation is annotated
with the relation particle di /di/, and is similar to a combinator but can have
named arguments.  The relation between farmer and land-farmed, Shand /ʃɐnd/,
can thus be used as: "muh nyo shi guh di shand nam", meaning "I am the farmer
of everything". As you can see, this particular relation is binary and infix,
meaning that it is placed between two classes, resulting in a new class.
Without the di, relations can be treated as identifiers, and one can treat any
identifier as a relation by applying di to it. Thus, you can describe a
relation via a constraint clause, as in "nya Genda shi ni Shand dosh nyo."
translating to "There is something called Genda. Genda is the intersection
between the relation of the farmer and his land and my own identity." Perhaps
Genda is my way of farming the land, something I'll write a self-help book
about one day.
