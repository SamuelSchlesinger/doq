# Grammar of Mednem

The primary structure of Mednem is the constraint. Instead of having words like
"this" or "that", one can introduce an arbitrary variable by naming it with an
introductory particle. The variables work the same way names do in English,
where they can be introduced and discussed for any period of time. A helpful
translation of the introductory particle in English might be "there exists X",
but don't take this too literally. There are two introductory particles, nyuh /ɲɜ/
and nya /ɲɐ/.

When one says nyuh Deeg /dig/, it introduces a new entity to our discussion
called Deeg. Deeg can now be used as an identifier. An identifier serves to
point to a specific person, concept, action, object, or really anything one can
think to identify with a name. One can use identifiers with constraining phrases
which can allow a listener or reader to identify what this name is referring to.
Identifiers can be combined via the phrase ha /hɐ/ to create a composite identifier
which refers to all of those things. The nya particle introduces a permanent identifier
specific to the social context in which it was said. This might be a good way of
telling someone your name, like "nya Sham shi nyo", where nyo /ɲʌ/ means something
like "me".

A constraining phrase consists of an identifier, potentially being introduced
by an introductory particle, and the constraining particle shi /ʃi/. After the
shi, there is a class which the identifier is a part of. There is the empty
class, dod /dʌd/, the class of every possible thing, nam /nɐm/, and a class
corresponding to every identifier, ni /ni/ [identifier], indicating all of the
possible things that identifier could refer to. Classes are similar to
adjectives and nouns in English in some ways. Essentially, they are ways to
group entities which serve both purposes. Classes can be unioned
with dosh /dɐʃ/, intersected with nosh /nɐʃ/, and negated with unye /ɜɲe/.
