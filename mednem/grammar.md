# Grammar of Mednem

The primary structure of Mednem is the constraint. Instead of having words like
"this" or "that", one can introduce an arbitrary variable by naming it with an
introductory particle. The variables work the same way names do in English,
where they can be introduced and discussed for any period of time. A helpful
translation of the introductory particle in English might be "there exists X",
but don't take this too literally. There are two introductory particles, nyuh /ɲɜ/
and nya /ʌɜ/.

When one says nyuh Deeg /dig/, it introduces a new entity to our discussion
called Deeg. Deeg can now be used as an identifier. An identifier serves to
point to a specific person, concept, action, object, or really anything one can
think to identify with a name. One can use identifiers with constraining phrases
which can allow a listener or reader to identify what this name is referring to.
Identifiers can be combined via the phrase ha /hɐ/ to create a composite identifier
which refers to all of those things. People tend to alternate between the use of
nyuh and nya when they're combining identifiers.

A constraining phrase consists of an identifier, potentially being introduced by
an introductory particle, and the constraining particle shi /ʃi/. After the shi,
there is a constraint which will be applied to the identifier.
